Write a program that plays Hangman as good as possible. For example you can use a large dictionary
 like this and select the letter that excludes most words that are still possible solutions. Try to 
 make the program as efficient as possible, i.e. don’t scan the whole dictionary in every turn.

Write a program that plays Rock, Paper, Scissors better than random against a human. Try to exploit 
that humans are very bad at generating random numbers.

Write a program that plays Battle Ship against human opponents. It takes coordinates as input and 
outputs whether that was a hit or not and its own shot’s coordinates.
